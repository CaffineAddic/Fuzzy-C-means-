# Fuzzy-C-means-
This is very basic implementation of Fuzzy c-means

This code only uses numpy and Matplotlib to impliment the Fuzzy C-means but it also has Sklearn to genrate random data
The output is shown in relationship matrix as well as in graphical form showing different graphs for different centers to demonstatrate the fuzzy C -means
